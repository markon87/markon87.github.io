        <h3>A creative Front-End Developer located in Bethesda, MD.</h3>
        <br />
        <p>I am passionate about creating beautiful and responsive web
solutions with engaging user-friendly experiences. With years of
experience in the industry, national and international clients
rely on me for design, implementation, and management of their
digital products. I love working in a team and bring up ideas
that help us create truly outstanding digital solutions.</p>
        <br /><br />
          <p>The websites that I deliver are built with the best practices
and optimized for performance and accessibility while meeting
the clientsâ€™ needs and expectations. I have a full-stack
developer experience with popular content management system
(WordPress). My main areas of interest are Front-End
development, HTML, CSS, JS, building small and medium web apps,
animations, and coding interactive layouts.</p>
        <br/><br/>
          <p>In my spare time, I enjoy working on my reef tank and go to my
local climbing gym.</p>
        <br/><br/>
