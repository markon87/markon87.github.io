        <h2>Hi! I'm Marko,</h2>
        <h3>A creative Frontend Engineer located in Bethesda, MD.</h3>
        <br />
        <p>I am a frontend engineer specializing in building modern ReactJS applications that are fast, scalable, and user-focused. My work centers on developing clean, reusable interfaces that integrate with RESTful APIs and bring complex data to life through clear, intuitive visualizations.</p>
        <br />
        <p>With many years of professional experience, I have led frontend efforts on projects ranging from internal dashboards to enterprise-level platformsâ€”often taking ownership from concept to launch in agile, cross-functional teams. I enjoy solving technical challenges through thoughtful UI architecture, performance optimization, and scalable component systems.</p>
        <br />
        <p>My recent work includes building data-driven applications that automate manual processes and help users interact with large datasets more effectively. I care deeply about crafting experiences that are not only functional and visually polished, but also accessible and maintainable.</p>
        <br />
        <p>While my background includes full-stack development and CMS platforms like WordPress, my current focus is on React, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, data visualization, and API integration. I also work with tools like Docker, AWS, and Azure DevOps, and I am always exploring new technologies that help improve developer workflow and end-user experience.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Please feel free to browse through my website and learn more
          about my skills and experience. If you have any questions or
          would like to discuss a potential project, please do not
          hesitate to get in touch. I am always interested in working on
          exciting new projects! Thank you for visiting!</p>
